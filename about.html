            <p>The Carolina Community Garden (or the CCG, formerly known as the Carolina Campus Community Garden) is an engagement program of the North Carolina Botanical Garden on the UNC Chapel Hill campus. We grow vegetables and fruit so all University employees can have access to fresh, sustainably-grown produce. We serve as a learning community for developing gardening skills, healthy living, social responsibility, and interdisciplinary academic pursuits. Our work is made possible by the shared efforts of staff, students, faculty, and local residents.</p>

            <p>We distribute our produce to UNC’s lower wage workers on designated distribution days. Most of the employees receiving CCG produce are University housekeepers.</p>
